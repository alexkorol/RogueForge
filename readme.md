# RogueForge
RogueForge is a Three.js/Node.js based action RPG/browser roguelike game with Metamask login and a sample map where the player can move around. The game features retro-style graphics with a 3D-style fixed-view scene, sprite player and objects, and grid-based movement with interpolation. Players can move around static and randomly-generated maps, click on monsters to attack and use skills, level up, upgrade skills via a complex tree system, craft and upgrade items, participate in special maps and challenges, and engage in PvP.
